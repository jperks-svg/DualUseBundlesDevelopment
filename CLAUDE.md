# APPNAME

A Cribl Search App (Vite + React + TypeScript) that runs inside
Cribl Search as a sandboxed iframe. Ship target: Cribl Cloud.
Local dev via `npm run dev`; package for upload with
`npm run package`; deploy to staging with `npm run deploy`.

## Developing

**Read these before making changes:**

1. **`AGENTS.md`** — Cribl App Platform developer reference (host
   globals, fetch proxy, proxies.yml, KV store, React Router).
   This is the official platform API surface.
2. **Framework `docs/skill.md`** (in
   `cribl-search-app-framework/docs/skill.md` if you have it
   checked out, or read it on GitHub) — KQL caveats (crashes,
   unsupported functions), sandboxed iframe constraints (no
   downloads, no popups, CSP), scheduled search patterns,
   provisioning, and UI patterns.

When building a feature, check `AGENTS.md` for the API surface
and `docs/skill.md` for known pitfalls. If you have the Cribl
MCP server running (see below), use it to inspect live APIs and
run test queries before writing client code.

## Cribl MCP

`.mcp.json` at the repo root tells Claude Code how to reach the
Cribl MCP server. It launches the `mcp-remote` bridge against
`http://127.0.0.1:3030/mcp`. The server itself runs in Docker.

`scripts/cribl-mcp.sh` manages the container:

```bash
scripts/cribl-mcp.sh start    # pull image (if needed), run container
scripts/cribl-mcp.sh stop     # stop + remove container
scripts/cribl-mcp.sh status   # show running state
scripts/cribl-mcp.sh logs     # follow container logs
```

The container reads `CRIBL_BASE_URL`, `CRIBL_CLIENT_ID`, and
`CRIBL_CLIENT_SECRET` from `.env`. Optional `CRIBL_MCP_API_KEY`
gates access to the server itself. To replicate on a fresh
machine: install Docker, populate `.env`, run
`scripts/cribl-mcp.sh start`, open this repo in Claude Code, and
the `mcp__cribl__*` tools become available.

## Deploying to staging

`npm run deploy` builds, packages, uploads the pack, and installs
it. If your app ships `scripts/provision.ts`, the deploy script
runs it automatically after install — same code path as
`npm run provision` standalone.

```bash
npm run deploy           # full pipeline
npm run provision        # reconcile scheduled searches only
npm run provision -- --dry  # show plan without applying
```

The provisioner prints each action:

```
▶ Reconciling provisioned resources …
✓  + create yourapp__metric_catalog
✓  ~ update yourapp__service_summary
✓  · noop   yourapp__home_panel
```

## Cutting a release

Releases are triggered by pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag — see
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow runs `npm ci`,
`npm run lint`, `npm run package`, and creates a GitHub Release
with the pack tgz attached.

**A lint failure on the tagged commit means no GitHub Release
gets published** and recovery requires either force-retagging or
bumping to a patch release. Catch failures locally before tagging.

**Required pre-tag checks** — run on the commit you're about to
tag, in a clean working tree:

```bash
npm run lint          # must pass — what the workflow gates on
npm test              # unit tests
npx tsc --noEmit      # type-check
npm run package       # full build + tgz produced
```

If any step fails, do not tag. Fix on `master` first.

**Tagging steps**:

1. Confirm CI is green on the commit you intend to tag.
2. Bump `package.json` `version` to the target `X.Y.Z`.
3. Commit as `chore: release X.Y.Z` with a body that lists the
   PRs / threads in the release.
4. Annotated tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"`.
5. `git push origin master vX.Y.Z`.
6. Confirm the release workflow succeeded:
   `gh run list --workflow=Release --limit 1` and
   `gh release view vX.Y.Z`.

The workflow verifies the `vX.Y.Z` tag matches `package.json`
version on the first step — keep them in sync.

## Cribl KQL caveats

- **`(?i)` inline regex flag crashes** in complex pipelines
  (summarize + extend + nested negation). Use character-class
  alternation `[Cc]onsume[d]?` instead.
- **`foldkeys`** operator exists but the output `key`/`value`
  columns don't support type filtering. Use `_raw` regex parsing
  for field-name discovery instead.
- **Route conflicts**: avoid using `/settings` in pack routes —
  the Cribl host shell intercepts paths containing "settings".
- **`summarize → summarize max(iff(...))`** crashes on real data
  (works on synthetic rows, fails on rows from a prior
  summarize). Split into separate searches joined via lookups.

See the framework `docs/skill.md` for the full list.

## PR conventions

- One purpose per PR. Bundling docs with the minimal code change
  that motivates them is fine; bundling unrelated refactors is
  not.
- Commit messages explain the *why*, not just the *what*. See
  `git log --oneline` for the house style.
- Include a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer when Claude collaborated on
  the commit.
